title: About
---

I’m a software engineer with over 6 years of experience—4 years in Go and 2.5 years in iOS development. I thrive as a “glue” between teams and systems, driven by ownership, product thinking, and a gap-filler mindset. I enjoy tackling tough technical challenges while keeping an eye on product impact.
